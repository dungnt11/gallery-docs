# Settings

## Enable optimize assets in store 2.0
![Settings optimize](/img/settings/enable-optimize-assets.png)
By default I disable this function. Because with store 2.0, we can install our app's assets without having to edit the theme. But most of the shops today still use the old theme store, if you don't enable it your store will have to download and run our script twice, this directly affects your store's performance.

## Optimize image
By default, I will enable it for you to speed up your page load.

As you can see, the gallery consists of 2 images, 1 thumbnail image, and 1 standard size image when you upload it. If this optimize option is enabled, the gallery thumbnail will have the width equal to the width you config. We recommend to set max width to 500px.
