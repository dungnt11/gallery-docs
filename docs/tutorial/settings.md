## Optimize image
By default, we will enable it for you to speed up your page load.

As you can see, the gallery consists of 2 images, 1 small thumbnail image, and 1 standard size image when you upload it. If this optimize option is enabled, the gallery thumbnail will have the width equal to the width you config. We recommend to set max width to 500px.
