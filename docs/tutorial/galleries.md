# Galleries list
This is the start page of the app, after you modify the gallery you will be moved here.

## Gallery item
![Gallery item](/img/tutorial/gallery-item.png)
You can create, edit, delete or preview galleries before publishing them on your website. These are easy to understand, but we have a few caveats.

## Clone
:::info
For clone, we don't clone publish, if you want to publish you need to activate it manually
:::

## Preview
:::info
When you click on the preview, you will probably be asked by the browser about opening the popup, oh, that's completely normal, please allow it. [Click to readmore](https://lexisnexis.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1102020/~/disable-pop-up-blockers-in-most-common-internet-browsers)

## Delete
:::info
When deleting galleries, we're not sure where you still use them, or if you need them, so we don't delete your photos, you need to do this manually from the [Library manage](/docs/tutorial/manage-docs-versions#41-image-manager)

## Publish

This is probably the most important and interesting feature, as it makes your website so much more usable. We always believe that Egallery not only brings beauty, it also gives you conversion rate.

Basically, you will have 3 ways to publish your gallery: section, install directly on the page or embed code.

When you click `Save and publish`, we will create a section containing your gallery, you need to follow the instructions below to add the gallery as a section. Before coming to this, we would like to introduce you to the Installed tab.

![Installed](/img/tutorial/installed.png)

Here we will simulate the directory tree where your gallery is installed. You can delete or view the gallery at locations on this directory tree.

### Install gallery as section
First of all, go to this location.
![Installed as section](/img/tutorial/publish-section-1.png)
Looking to the left menu, you will see the default shopify interface table of contents, please click here.

![Custom section](/img/tutorial/add-section.png)

And find our section, we will name it based on the title you set, otherwise we will name it after the gallery identifier which you can find at the gallery details page.
![Url](/img/tutorial/url.png)
In the image above the string `pZI9-tLzN` is the gallery identifier, you can find your section under the name `EGallery-pZI9-tLzN`

### Import gallery to page
You can also import gallery into your page. Here you can select Page and Location where you want to import your gallery.
![Import to page](/img/tutorial/publish-page.png)

### Install gallery using embed code
You can also import gallery into your page using embed code. This is a useful method for developers.
