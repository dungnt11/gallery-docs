You can create, edit, delete or preview galleries before publishing them on your website. It is easy to understand, but we have a few caveats.

## Clone
:::info
For clone, we don't clone publish, if you want to publish you need to activate it manually
:::

## Preview
:::info
When you click on the preview, you will probably be asked by the browser about opening the popup, oh, that's completely normal, please allow it. [Click to readmore](https://lexisnexis.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1102020/~/disable-pop-up-blockers-in-most-common-internet-browsers)

## Delete
:::info
When deleting galleries, we're not sure where you still use them, or if you need them, so we don't delete your photos, you need to do this manually from the [Library manage](/docs/tutorial/manage-docs-versions#41-image-manager)
